Midterm Project: Modelling House Prices

Group Members: Louisa & Hannah

Goal of the project, what you want to achieve. Please specify if it is a modelling or BI project

Brief description of the dataset:

Source: historic housing data from a real estate company
Number of features: 21 columns 
Number of rows: 21.597 entries

Objective: The task is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. 
The senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tool. 
One of those parameters include understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above. 
The questions have been provided later in the document for which you can use tableau.
